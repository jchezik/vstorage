  <!-- The Story -->
  <section class="py-4xl bg-white">

        <div>
          <h2 class="text-h2 text-gray-900 mb-lg">The Problem:</h2>
          <p class="text-body-lg text-gray-700">
            In 2024, a group of audio engineers and producers in Zurich faced a frustrating reality: no cloud storage platform respected the integrity of lossless audio. Services would compress files, limit formats, or bury masters in generic file browsers designed for documents and photos.
          </p>
          <p class="text-body-lg text-gray-700 mt-lg">
            Worse, storing valuable master recordings on US-based cloud services meant placing them under foreign jurisdiction, vulnerable to data requests and surveillance programs. Musicians deserved better.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h2 class="text-h2 text-gray-900 mb-lg">The Solution:</h2>
          <p class="text-body-lg text-gray-700">
            VStorage was built from the ground up for professional audio. Not adapted, not retrofitted—built specifically for musicians, producers, and audio engineers who refuse to compromise on quality or security.
          </p>
          <p class="text-body-lg text-gray-700 mt-lg">
            We chose Switzerland not for novelty, but for its unparalleled data protection laws. We chose zero-knowledge encryption not as a feature, but as a fundamental architectural requirement. We chose lossless formats not as an option, but as the only acceptable standard.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h2 class="text-h2 text-gray-900 mb-lg">Today:</h2>
          <p class="text-body-lg text-gray-700">
            VStorage is designed for independent producers, recording studios, and labels who understand that great music deserves great storage. Built for professionals who demand the highest audio quality, our platform preserves your master recordings, demos, and entire catalogs exactly as created, protected by mathematics and Swiss law.
