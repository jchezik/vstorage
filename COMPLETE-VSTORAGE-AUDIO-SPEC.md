## TECH STACK DECISION

**Frontend Framework:** Astro 4.x + Tailwind CSS
**Why:** 
- Astro is perfect for content-heavy marketing sites
- Static site generation = fastest possible performance
- Built-in image optimization
- Component-based architecture
- SEO-optimized out of the box
- Can integrate React/Vue components if needed later

**Backend (Future Product):**
For the actual product backend (not building now, just documenting):
- Node.js + Express or Fastify for API
- PostgreSQL for metadata/user management
- S3-compatible object storage for audio files
- Redis for caching
- WebSocket for real-time collaboration

**For Now (Marketing Site Only):**
- Astro (handles both frontend rendering and build process)
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- No backend needed (static site)

**Deployment:**
- Vercel (optimized for Astro, automatic deployments)
- CloudFlare CDN (global distribution)

### SECURITY PAGE

**Page Hero:**
```
Title: Your Masters. Protected.
Subtitle: Enterprise-grade security for professional audio
```

**Main Content:**
```
Section 1: Zero-Knowledge Encryption

What it means:
Zero-knowledge architecture concept — designed so even we could not access your files. 
Every audio file is encrypted on your device before upload, using AES-256-GCM 
encryption. We never see your unencrypted data—we only store encrypted bytes.

How it works:

1. File Selection
You select an audio file to upload (e.g., Master_Final.wav)

2. Client-Side Encryption
Your browser generates a unique encryption key and encrypts the file using 
AES-256-GCM before any data leaves your device. This happens using Web Crypto API.

3. Encrypted Upload
Only the encrypted data is transmitted over TLS 1.3 to our servers. 
The encryption key never leaves your device.

4. Encrypted Storage
The encrypted file is stored in our Swiss data center. We only see encrypted bytes—
the content is mathematically inaccessible to us.

5. Decryption on Download
When you access the file, it's downloaded encrypted and decrypted in your browser 
using your key. Only you can decrypt your files.

Technical Details:
• Algorithm: AES-256-GCM (Galois/Counter Mode)
• Key size: 256-bit (2^256 possible keys)
• Mode: Authenticated encryption with associated data (AEAD)
• Key derivation: PBKDF2 with 100,000 iterations
• Salt: Unique per user, cryptographically random
• Authentication: Built-in authentication tag prevents tampering

Why AES-256-GCM:
• NSA approved for TOP SECRET data
• NIST recommended
• FIPS 140-2 validated
• Used by: US Government, banks, militaries worldwide
• No known practical attacks
• Quantum resistant (256-bit provides post-quantum security)

---

Section 2: Swiss Data Residency Principles

Why Switzerland:
Switzerland has the strongest privacy laws in the world and is not subject to 
EU or US jurisdiction. Swiss data sovereignty means your data is protected by 
Swiss Federal Data Protection Act (FADP), which provides stronger privacy 
protections than GDPR.

Swiss privacy advantages — principles that inspire our design:
• Not subject to CLOUD Act (US)
• Not subject to EU data retention directives
• No mandatory data handover to foreign governments
• Strong privacy tradition (banking secrecy)
• Federal data protection constitution
• Criminal penalties for privacy violations

Our Swiss Infrastructure:

Data Center Location: Zurich, Switzerland
• Coordinates: 47.3769° N, 8.5417° E
• Owned and operated by: Green.ch (Swiss company)
• ISO 27001:2013-aligned
• Tier III-grade facility (99.982% uptime)

Physical Security:
• 24/7 security monitoring
• Biometric access control (fingerprint + iris scan)
• Man-trap entry (two-door vestibule)
• Video surveillance (90-day retention)
• Seismic protection (earthquake resistant)
• Faraday cage (EMI/RFI protection)

Power & Cooling:

### ABOUT PAGE

**Page Hero:**
```
Title: Built for Musicians, by Musicians
Subtitle: The story of VStorage
```

**Main Content:**
```
The Problem:
In 2024, a group of audio engineers and producers in Zurich faced a frustrating 
reality: no cloud storage platform respected the integrity of lossless audio. 
Services would compress files, limit formats, or bury masters in generic file 
browsers designed for documents and photos.

Worse, storing valuable master recordings on US-based cloud services meant 
placing them under foreign jurisdiction, vulnerable to data requests and 
surveillance programs. Musicians deserved better.

The Solution:
VStorage was built from the ground up for professional audio. Not adapted, 
not retrofitted—built specifically for musicians, producers, and audio engineers 
who refuse to compromise on quality or security.

We chose Switzerland not for novelty, but for its unparalleled data protection 
laws. We chose zero-knowledge encryption not as a feature, but as a fundamental 
architectural requirement. We chose lossless formats not as an option, but as 
the only acceptable standard.

Today:
VStorage serves independent producers, recording studios, and labels who 
understand that great music deserves great storage. Every day, professionals 
trust us with their master recordings, demos, and entire catalogs—knowing 
their work is preserved exactly as created, protected by mathematics and 
Swiss law.

Our Mission:
Preserve the integrity of professional audio in the cloud era. Every bit, 
every sample, exactly as recorded.

Our Values:

Audio Quality First
Never compromise on sound. Every format supported at full quality. No transcoding, 
no resampling, no "good enough." If you recorded it at 192kHz/32-bit, that's 
exactly how we store it.

Swiss Precision
Security and reliability aren't nice-to-haves—they're requirements. We apply 
Swiss engineering principles to every aspect: precise, methodical, uncompromising.

Zero Knowledge
Your music is yours. We build our entire architecture around the principle that 
we should never be able to access your files. Not "we promise not to"—we 
mathematically cannot.

Professional Tools
Built for professionals by professionals. Every feature designed for real audio 
workflows, informed by decades of combined studio experience.

The Team:
VStorage is a Swiss company headquartered in Zürich. Our team includes:
• Audio engineers with 20+ years studio experience
• Security engineers from banking and government sectors
• Software developers from CERN and ETH Zürich
• UI/UX designers specializing in professional audio tools

We're a small team focused on doing one thing exceptionally well: secure, 
lossless audio storage for professionals.

Location:
Zürich, Switzerland
Swiss company registered with UID: CHE-XXX.XXX.XXX (example format)
